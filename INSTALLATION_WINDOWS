In order to run DSM_simulator.py under Windows you need:
- python 2.7 64bit (required to run the GUI and plotting scripts)
- MinGW (required to compile c++ code)
- Miktex (latex distribution to make plots look nice)

To install MinGW:
- download mingw-get-setup.exe
	from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/
- install MinGW
	run mingw-get-setup.exe as administrator
	check all packages from the Basic Setup
	click on Apply Changes in the Installation menu

To install python 2.7 64bit:
- download Windows x86-64 MSI installer
	from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/
	run the installer
- run regedit
	click on the magnifying glass
	write regedit then <enter>
	go to "\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environement"
	double-click on "Path" and add ";<the location of MinGW>\bin;<the location of python>;<the location of python>\Scripts"
	by default the locations of MinGW and of Python are C:\MinGW and C:\Python27
	reboot the computer
	open a terminal and write "python", python terminal should open.
	exit by writing: "exit()"
- install pip
	download get-pip.py 
	from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
	in the terminal run python <location of get-pip.py>\get-pip.py 

- install libraries from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
	- pandas
	- matplotlib
	- numpy >= 1.11.0
	- scipy >= 0.17.0 (should be installed after numpy)
	- pillow
	for all these packages there are multiple .whl files, the good ones have cp27 and amd64
	ex: numpy-1.11.1+mkl-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl
	the install command: pip install <a package ending by .whl>

-install miktex 
	download and install Miktex from	
	http://miktex.org/download

Compile the c++ exes:
	Open a terminal: click on the magnifying glass (or windows symbol)
	write cmd then <enter>
	write cd "<location DSM_simulator>\src" 
	run "mingw32-make -f Makefile_w"

Run DSM_simulator.py:
	double-click on DSM_simulator.py
